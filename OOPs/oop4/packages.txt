There are two typesofpackages in java :-
Inbild package
User defined packages

-Built-in packages: In java, we already have various pre-defined packages and these packages contain large numbers of classes and interfaces that we used in java are known as Built-in packages.
-User-defined packages: As the name suggests user-defined packages are a package that is defined by the user or programmer.


-Built-in packages :- The built-in packages have come in the form of JAR files and when we unzip the JAR files we can easily see the packages in JAR files, for example, lang, io, util, SQL, etc. Java provides various built-in packages for example java.awt
